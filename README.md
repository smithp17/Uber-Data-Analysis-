## Project Overview

The Uber Data Pipeline project is an end-to-end data engineering project that involves:
- Analyzing Uber data stored in GCP Storage.
- Using Python scripts for data transformation.
- Setting up and utilizing GCP Compute Instances.
- Implementing data pipelines with the Mage Data Pipeline Tool.
- Performing data analysis with BigQuery.
- Visualizing data insights with Looker Studio.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uber-data-pipeline.git
    cd uber-data-pipeline
    ```

2. **Set up the Python environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up Google Cloud SDK**:
    - Install the Google Cloud SDK from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
    - Initialize the SDK and authenticate:
        ```bash
        gcloud init
        gcloud auth application-default login
        ```

4. **Set up Mage**:
    - Follow the installation guide for Mage from their [official documentation](https://docs.mage.ai/installation).

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Upload the Uber dataset to your GCP Storage bucket.

2. **Run Data Transformation**:
    - Execute the Python scripts to transform and preprocess the data.
    - Example:
        ```bash
        python transform_data.py
        ```

3. **Set Up and Run Data Pipeline**:
    - Configure and run the Mage data pipeline to process the data.
    - Example:
        ```bash
        mage start
        ```

4. **Analyze Data with BigQuery**:
    - Use BigQuery to run SQL queries on the processed data.
    - Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM `your-project.your-dataset.your-table`
        ```

5. **Visualize Data with Looker Studio**:
    - Connect Looker Studio to your BigQuery dataset and create interactive dashboards.
